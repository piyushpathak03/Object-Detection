# RCNN
Step-By-Step Implementation of R-CNN from scratch in python

# R-CNN
To bypass the problem of selecting a huge number of regions, Ross Girshick et al. proposed a method where we use selective search to extract just 2000 regions from the image and he called them region proposals. Therefore, now, instead of trying to classify a huge number of regions, you can just work with 2000 regions. These 2000 region proposals are generated using the selective search algorithm which is written below.
R-CNN models first select several proposed regions from an image (for example, anchor boxes are one type of selection method) and then label their categories and bounding boxes (e.g., offsets). Then, they use a CNN to perform forward computation to extract features from each proposed area. Afterwards, we use the features of each proposed region to predict their categories and bounding boxes


Selective Search:
1. Generate initial sub-segmentation, we generate many candidate     regions
2. Use greedy algorithm to recursively combine similar regions into larger ones 
3. Use the generated regions to produce the final candidate region proposals 

Specifically, R-CNNs are composed of four main parts:

Selective search is performed on the input image to select multiple high-quality proposed regions [Uijlings et al., 2013]. These proposed regions are generally selected on multiple scales and have different shapes and sizes. The category and ground-truth bounding box of each proposed region is labeled.

A pre-trained CNN is selected and placed, in truncated form, before the output layer. It transforms each proposed region into the input dimensions required by the network and uses forward computation to output the features extracted from the proposed regions.

The features and labeled category of each proposed region are combined as an example to train multiple support vector machines for object classification. Here, each support vector machine is used to determine whether an example belongs to a certain category.

The features and labeled bounding box of each proposed region are combined as an example to train a linear regression model for ground-truth bounding box prediction.

Although R-CNN models use pre-trained CNNs to effectively extract image features, the main downside is the slow speed. As you can imagine, we can select thousands of proposed regions from a single image, requiring thousands of forward computations from the CNN to perform object detection. This massive computing load means that R-CNNs are not widely used in actual applications.



Problems with R-CNN
It still takes a huge amount of time to train the network as you would have to classify 2000 region proposals per image.
It cannot be implemented real time as it takes around 47 seconds for each test image.
The selective search algorithm is a fixed algorithm. Therefore, no learning is happening at that stage. This could lead to the generation of bad candidate region proposals.
